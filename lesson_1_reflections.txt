Reflection on finding the difference in two codes using FC in cmd.

After downloading the two game files, game_new.js and game_old.js. I opened command prompt.
A colleague helped me set the directory to the local disk. I then changed the directory to Downloads folder which i thought was the directory for the two files i downloaded. When i run the FC command, i got an error. I later checked to find out the files were in the Documents folder not the Downloads folder. I edited the FC command and run it again, this time it worked. Using the FC to compare codes is a lot easier and it will really help in bug finding. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Having easy access to the entire history of the file would have provided context of which changed was made and why they were made. This would make adding
new features or deleting features more easier. I will having access to the entire history of a file will make me more efficient programmer.
